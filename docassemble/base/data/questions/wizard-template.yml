  Signature collection page
subquestion: |
  The variable `${ x.field_list[0].variable }` will be the image of the
  user's signature.  The screen that asks for the signature is
  configurable.

  Click Help to see a model of the various parts of the signature
  gathering screen.
help: |
  These are these parts of the signature collection screen:
  
  [FILE docassemble.base:sample-signature.png]

  If your users are using smartphones, it is a good idea to leave
  the text above the signature blank, and keep all text very short so
  that it does not go onto more than one line.
  
  % if len(varsinuse['all_names_reduced']):
  You can include the value of a variable by enclosing it in

  What type of answer is required to the question
  "${ x.question_text }"
subquestion: |
  For example, if the type of question is "Simple yes/no," then
  `${ x.field_list[0].variable }` will be defined either as `True` or
  `False`.

  What is the name of the document that will be assembled using
  the template `${ x.markdown_filename }`?
subquestion: |
  E.g., if the name is "Complaint for Custody," then on the final

  How would you like to name your interview?
subquestion: |
  The **File name** is the name of the interview within the [Playground].

  The **Title** is the name that the user will see on the [Interview
  List] and in the upper-left corner of the screen.

  The **Short title** is the name that mobile users will see in the
  upper-left corner of the screen.

  [Playground]: ${ url_of('playground') }
  [Interview List]: ${ url_of('interviews') }
fields:
  - File name: x.file_name
  - Title: x.title
  - Short title: x.short_title

question: |
  Wizard for a simple document assembly interview
subquestion: |
  This wizard will create a **docassemble** interview that assembles
  one or more documents for the user.

  It will ask you to upload one or more Word documents you have marked
  up with variable names in square brackets.  For example, your Word
  document may contain the text:

  > Your phone number is \[phone number\] and you live in \[city\].

  The wizard will build a **docassemble** interview that gathers
  definitions of necessary variables `phone_number` and `city` in
  order to create the assembled document.

  The Word file(s) you upload will be converted to [Markdown].  As a
  result, some of the formatting in the documents will likely be lost.
  This is the way **docassemble** works.  See the [Documents] section
  of the documentation for more information about formatting documents
  in **docassemble**.

  You can also upload templates in [Markdown] format, or use
  already-uploaded files instead of uploading new files.
  
  Once your interview has been created, it will be available in the
  [Playground], where you can edit it.

  This wizard is primarily a tool to help new interview authors learn
  how to write **docassemble** interviews.  There are many features in
  **docassemble** that are not available with this wizard.
